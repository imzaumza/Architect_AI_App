## Abstract
The connection of architecture and artificial intelligence is quite clear-cut. 
Planning and building are expedited by AI. You can't complete these two chores in a single day. 
AI will produce models and useful data. That is what people mean when they refer to an estimating tool.

The information is also useful for building the foundation. 
The AI can help you create the best conceptual design in only a millisecond by aggregating complex data. 
It is ideal for swiftly producing variations. In essence, 
it streamlines the construction process as a whole and saves time.

AI is developing scalable and reliable design systems. It has the ability to construct models, evaluate the architectural environment, and list cost projections. 
The most crucial part is that a design plan can use all of the information. 
It will speed up construction and enable architects to create a special design for each client.

## Summary
Every convergence of artificial intelligence and architecture exposes a stepping stone to a brighter future. 
From my perspective, it generates creativity, innovation, and opens the door to entirely new possibilities. 
With AI, architects can spend less time and effort studying data and more time and effort on pushing their buildings to the next level. 
That is why I believe architects should employ AI as a sort of empowerment in their daily work.
